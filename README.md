# Project Week - Quiz Tracker App

## Summary

This project was made by Ted Phillips, Mary Chukwuma, Simon Prato and Najma Diiriye over the week of 17/1/22-22/1/22. The purpose of the Quiz Tracker App was to create an MVP(minimum viable product) for an app that fulfils a need of fellow bootcampers. We do morning recap quizes on the previous day's topic however, we found that we had no way of looking back on our scores, and visualise how we were doing. We met this need by allowing the bootcamper to enter their scores into a submission form. The scores would then be stored and retrieved by our back-end and displayed as a chart on the front-end. The bars of the chart change color depending on the score you achieved allowing you to visualise your progress. You can also delete a score if you need to.

## Instructions

1. Open the app using [this link](https://quiztrackerapp.netlify.app/).
2. Give it a moment to retrieve the data
3. Add and remove scores

## What went well?

I managed to create a lot of React components successfully and use logic to process data from the backend. It also gave me lots of experience in linking up the front-end of an app up to the back-end which connected a lot of dots for me, deepening my understanding of web-development. Furthermore, this project allowed me to better my ability of CSS, using CSS flexbox and grid as well as some pseudo classes such as :hover and :active. Finally, this project gave the team and I some great experience using agile methodologies such as kanban boards, retrospectives and planning sessions. I think that was the largest non-technical takeaway as I realised just how important good communication in a team is.

## What would you do differently?

Firstly, I would have used Styled-Components to style the page, this because for me it saves time and it allows me to hand down props to styled components which would've made the coloring of the bars much easier. In our final retrospective, we collectively agreed that we would have liked to add an authorisation system such as Auth0 as this would allows us to use a different chart for each user. This would also allow us to have used react router to direct users from a landing page to their table/s. We also agreed that given more time, we could have used the app for students looking to document their progression in different topics, we then could have calculated their overall grades using the weighting from individual topics.
